A Bun website of routes and resources, with railroad for the page and Railway for
the deploy, started from [paintbrush](https://github.com/blueshed/paintbrush).

Open it in two windows: a save in one shows in the other.

\`\`\`sh
bun dev            # http://localhost:3000, hot reload
bun run start      # the same source in production: nothing to build
bun test           # tests, held at 100% coverage
bun run typecheck
\`\`\`

\`CLAUDE.md\` says what is here and the rules. The \`evolve\` skill adds or changes a
resource: a route, a live push, SQLite, S3, a delta document. \`todo.jsonl\` is the
ledger of open work; \`CHANGELOG.md\` records what has changed.

// postinstall), never on import: tests call setup() on a scratch folder.
