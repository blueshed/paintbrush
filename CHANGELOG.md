## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-03

Paintbrush is again what it was for: routes and resources, with railroad for the page and
Railway for the deploy, that a resource can evolve from. It follows the Bun website conventions
(a small core, tests at 100%), so this release moves nearly everything. It is 0.5.0, after 0.2.4:
the tags `v0.3.0` and `v0.4.0` were taken in February by the framework this replaced, so this
is the first free version.

### Breaking (for apps started from 0.2.x)

- **delta is no longer in the box.** A resource starts as HTTP routes: `GET`/`PUT /api/message`
  and `GET /api/status`, each with a fetching store. `/ws`, `registerDoc`, `registerMethod` and
  `call("status")` are gone, with the imports of `@blueshed/railroad/delta-client` and
  `delta-server`, which railroad removed in 0.7. A resource evolves to a WebSocket and then to a
  delta document: the `evolve` skill has each step, with its tests.
- **Everything is under `src/`.** `src/server.ts` lists the routes and exports `startServer()`,
  `src/main.ts` is the entry point (`dev` is `bun --hot src/main.ts`), and resources are in
  `src/resources/`.
- **`GET /api/status` no longer says where the data is.** It answers `persistent`, `uptime` and
  `bun`; it used to send the server's absolute data path to any client.
- **The default message is "Hello", the heading is "Message", and there is no favicon.** The
  template's name and logo no longer end up in an app.
- **Removed:** the Dockerfile, `@railway/cli`, `feather-icons`, the `/sample` style guide page
  and the `/add-resource` skill (its references pointed at files that no longer existed).

### Changed

- **`CHANGELOG.md` and `todo.jsonl` are named as a pair.** They are the project's memory between
  sessions: the changelog is where it has been, the ledger what is open now. `CLAUDE.md` says to
  read both before starting, and that they move together as work lands: an entry under
  `[Unreleased]`, and the item it settles marked fixed with a dated note. A new app's README and
  the `evolve` skill's checklist say the same. The docs had described the two files apart, and
  an agent that read `CLAUDE.md` took them as separate housekeeping.
- **Bun comes first.** The README and `CLAUDE.md` open with Bun as the server of routes and
  resources, with a WebSocket, SQLite and S3 built in; railroad and Railway come after, as the
  way on.
- **`message` pushes over a WebSocket.** `/ws` is the app's one socket. Each socket subscribes to
  the `message` topic, and `PUT /api/message` publishes what it saved with `server.publish`, so
  every open page follows. The view keeps typing that has not been saved. The store opens the
  socket again when it closes, and loads the message again in case a save was missed. A
  resource without a push (`status`) is still plain HTTP.
- **The `evolve` skill starts from the new app.** Step 2 (a WebSocket) is now what `message`
  does, so the skill describes it instead of giving an echo socket. Step 3 (delta) removes the
  app's `/ws` along with the message routes, and its tests are rewritten for that. It was
  applied to a scratch copy and run: 15 site tests pass at 100%, three runs.
- **`CLAUDE.md` holds what every session needs, and the skill holds the how.** `CLAUDE.md` is
  44 lines of what is here and the rules, and sends adding or changing a resource to the
  `evolve` skill. The skill's `SKILL.md` is the ladder, a workflow and a list of sections. Its
  `references.md`, read only when needed, has a table of contents and one section per task,
  each with code and tests: add a resource, push over the WebSocket, SQLite, S3, a delta
  document, eta, and an optional build.
- **No build.** A hello world runs from source: `bun run start` serves `src/main.ts` with hot
  reload off, and Bun bundles the page on its first request. The `build` and `serve:dist`
  scripts and the build test are gone, Railway runs `bun install` then `bun run start`, and
  `bun test` no longer leaves a `dist/` behind. A build is an optional section of the skill's
  references.
- railroad is `^0.15.1` (was `^0.6.1`); Bun is 1.4 or later; TypeScript 7.
- The rules sit next to what they describe: the design's at the top of `styles.css` (108 lines,
  from 268: only what the page uses), the browser-test rules at the top of the test file, the
  Railway rules at the top of `railway.ts`.

### Added

- **`/release`** (`.claude/commands/release.md`), in every new app. It checks (`main`, a clean
  tree, not behind, unreleased entries, the changelog and the ledger agreeing, a tag that is
  free), runs the typecheck and the tests, turns `[Unreleased]` into the version, takes the
  settled items out of `todo.jsonl`, bumps with `bun pm version --no-git-tag-version`, then
  commits, tags and pushes. With no argument it reports where things stand. Tried first in a
  scratch repo: `bun pm version` refuses any uncommitted change, and onto a tag that already
  exists it commits and then fails, so the command bumps only and tags itself, after checking
  the tag is free.
- A new app starts at version 0.0.0, not the template's, so its first `/release minor` makes
  0.1.0. Setup changes only the `version` line of `package.json`.
- **Icons are lucide, from the start.** `lucide` is a dependency, and `src/resources/icon.tsx` draws
  an icon as a real SVG node (`<Icon icon={Save} />`), sized by the text around it, hidden from
  screen readers beside a label and read out as `label` when alone. The Save button has one, and
  a browser test checks it. `CLAUDE.md` makes it the rule: lucide, through `<Icon>`, never
  another icon set or inline SVG.
- The `evolve` skill's references show how to use SQLite (`bun:sqlite`) and S3 (`Bun.s3`) as
  resources, with their handlers, their routes and their tests, including a stand-in S3 bucket of a few lines so tests
  need no real one. These are not in the box. Run on Bun 1.4.2 in a scratch copy: S3 against
  MinIO and against the stand-in, and the copy's whole suite at 100%.
- A pid file and `bun run stop`, so a server started in the background can be stopped.
- Tests, held at 100% coverage: every route and method with `fetch`, the page and what it does
  in a real browser (`Bun.WebView`), the entry point and pid file by spawning them, the
  production server running from source, and `create/setup.ts`. `bun run typecheck` checks the app, the tests,
  `create/` and `railway.ts`.
- The deploy in the box: `bun run start`, `/health`, and `.railway/railway.ts` with a volume for
  the data.
- The Claude Code web sandbox, whose Bun is older than this app needs and which has no browser:
  a SessionStart hook (railroad's, adapted) installs the latest Bun and a headless Chromium
  there, and does nothing anywhere else. A CI workflow runs the typecheck and the tests on
  GitHub, with Chrome.
- `create/setup.ts`, the template's `bun create` postinstall: a fresh `todo.jsonl` and
  `CHANGELOG.md`, the app's name, and railroad's skill in `.claude/skills` (not its `bun-route`
  skill, which tells a session to run `bun init` and use Playwright). It refuses to run in a
  clone of the template, and ends by leaving the new repository committed: bun create's own git
  step runs while the script does and can fail on a file the script has just deleted (found
  when a new app had no first commit). Run from GitHub on `main` after the merge, twice: both
  times bun create's git step failed that way and setup left one commit and a clean tree, and
  the new app's 17 tests pass at 100%.
- `todo.jsonl`, the ledger of open work, and a `.claude/launch.json` for the dev server.
- On npm: `create-blueshed` 0.3.0 (published from the invoket repo) runs `bun create
  blueshed/paintbrush`, so `bunx create-blueshed myapp`, `bun create blueshed myapp` and
  `npm create blueshed myapp` all make a paintbrush app. This repo itself is not an npm package.

### Fixed

- The `evolve` skill's step 3 view stopped following the other windows once it had saved
  itself: it took a new value only when the box still held what it last took from the document,
  and after a save the box held the saved text instead. It now also takes a value the box
  already holds. The bug showed when a test was added for it.

From the 24 Sep review of 0.2.4:

- The message view showed an empty box when you came back to `/`, because its effect ran before
  the textarea existed.
- A save from another window overwrote what you were typing.
- "Saved" appeared before the write had been answered, so a failed write still said it.
- A failed status call left the status area blank.
- `og:image` was a relative URL, which link-preview crawlers ignore; the tags are gone.
