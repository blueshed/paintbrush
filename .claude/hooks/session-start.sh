# SessionStart hook: provision the Claude Code web sandbox so `bun test`, browser
# tests included, runs there.
#
# WHY: the web sandbox's Bun is OLDER than this app needs (Bun.WebView wants 1.4), and the
# sandbox has NO BROWSER, and the hosts browsers are downloaded from are blocked. npm and
# GitHub are reachable. So this installs the latest Bun from npm, and a headless Chromium
# from an npm package, and points BUN_CHROME_PATH at it. If browser tests fail in the sandbox,
# run it by hand: CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR=$PWD CLAUDE_ENV_FILE=/dev/null bash .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
#
# Copied from railroad's hook of the same name, which is where the reasons below were found
# out; change them there first. Web sandbox only: locally you already have Bun and a
# browser, so it exits at once. Runs synchronously, so Bun, the dependencies and the
# browser are ready before the agent loop starts. Idempotent.
